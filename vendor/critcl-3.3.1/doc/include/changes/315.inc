[list_begin enumerated]

[enum] Fixed issue #19. Made the regular expression extracting the
       MSVC version number more general to make it work on german
       language systems. This may have to be revisited in the future,
       for other Windows locales.

[enum] Fixed issue #20. Made option -tea work on windows, at least in
       a unix emulation environment like msys/mingw.
