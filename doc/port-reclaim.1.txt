NAME
----
port-reclaim -  Reclaims disk space. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdNy*] *reclaim*
    [--keep-build-deps]
    [--enable-reminders] [--disable-reminders]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port reclaim* will find files that can be removed to reclaim disk space by uninstalling inactive ports on your
system as well as unnecessary unrequested ports, and removing unneeded or unused installation files.  The user is then provided interactive options for files to remove.  No files are removed initially, until the user selects them from the provided list.

OPTIONS
-------
*--keep-build-deps*::
Normally, ports are considered to be needed if they are either requested
or a runtime dependency of another needed port. Using this option causes
ports that are a build-time dependency of another needed port to also be
considered needed.

*--enable-reminders*::
Enable regular reminders to run *port reclaim*. Using this option will only
update the configuration; the reclaim process will not be run.

*--disable-reminders*::
Disable reminders to run *port reclaim*. Using this option will only
update the configuration; the reclaim process will not be run.

*-N*::
Non-interactive mode, uninstall ports and remove distfiles without asking for
confirmation.

*-y*::
Perform a dry run. No ports will be uninstalled and distfiles will not be
removed from disk, even if confirmed by the user.
